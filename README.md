## Project Description

This is a repo of R files designed for statistical analysis of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) over time from [Medicare Health Outcomes Survey database](https://hosonline.org/en/). It includes a set of functions for data cleaning, balance diagnostics, and propensity score matching with covariate adjustment. 

## Features

- Feature 1: Preprocess datasets from PUFs (public use files)
    - Preprocessing not included: conversion of ASCII PUF files to csv using [Medicare HOS user manuals](https://hosonline.org/en/data-dissemination/data-users-guides/). Converted PUF csv files used in this analysis can be found in this repo.
- Feature 2: Baseline imbalance assessment and identification of covariates
- Feature 3: Propensity score matching between two cohorts of Medicare patients, cohort 1 (1998) and cohort 23 (2020).
- Feature 4: 

- TODO: visualize data with ggplot2-based plots (2), run regression models with a single function (3)

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub

You can use the `devtools` package to install the project directly from GitHub.

1. Install the `devtools` package if you donâ€™t have it already:
    ```r
    install.packages("devtools")
    ```

2. Install the project:
    ```r
    devtools::install_github("vstevensf/medicare_hos")
    ```

### Option 2: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vstevensf/medicare_hos.git
    ```

2. Open the R project in RStudio or another IDE, and install required dependencies. You can install all packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` or `requirements.R`: TODO edit this

    ```r
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse"))  # Add relevant package names
    ```

## Usage

R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)

### Preprocessing/Data Cleaning
Files: `vic_preprocessing.R`, `C1_1998_PUF.csv`, `C23A_2020_PUF.csv`

This script:
1. reads in the cohort PUF csv files, which contain Medicare patient responses to the Medicare HOS (years: 1998 and 2020) 
2. extracts relevant columns containing demographic information and PROMs
3. standardizes scoring of certain categorical variables
4. checks for empty values and removes those records

### Baseline Imbalance Assessment + 

1. initial imbalance assessment
2. ddd
3. Standardized mean difference analysis to assess covariate balance (> .1 --> index of residual imbalance)
4. TODO; graphical diagnostics to assess covariate balance --> a) mirrored histogram for distribution of propensity score in the original and matched groups, b) Love plot of the SMDs for quick overview of balance

basically, the propensity score is a "balancing score" such that baseline covariate distribution is the same across treatment arms

### Propensity Score Matching
propensity score estimated using logistic regression model in which treatment states is regressed on the measured baseline covariates

propensity score matching by logistic regression using linear terms, no interaction or stratification
