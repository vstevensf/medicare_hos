## Project Description

This is a repo of R files designed for statistical analysis of patient-reported outcome measures over time from [Medicare Health Outcomes Survey database](https://hosonline.org/en/). It includes a set of functions for data cleaning, propensity score matching and covariate adjustment, and balance diagnostics. 

## Features

- Feature 1: Preprocess datasets from PUFs (public use files)
- Feature 2: Visualize data with ggplot2-based plots
- Feature 3: Run regression models with a single function

- Preprocessing not included in this repo: conversion of ASCII PUF files to csv (converted files included here) using Medicare HOS user manuals

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and set up your R project. Depending on the nature of your project (an R package, script, or Shiny app), the installation steps may vary.

    ```

2. Open the R project in RStudio or another IDE, and install required dependencies. You can install all packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` or `requirements.R`:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse"))  # Add relevant package names
    ```

## Usage

Provide instructions for using your project. Include sample code and examples if possible.

### Example 1: Data Cleaning
