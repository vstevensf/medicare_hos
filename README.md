## Project Description

Provide a brief description of the project. Explain what the project does, why it exists, and who it's for.

Example:
> This project is an R package designed for statistical analysis of large datasets. It includes a set of functions for data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling.

## Features

List some key features of your project. Highlight what makes it special.

- Feature 1: Clean and preprocess datasets
- Feature 2: Visualize data with ggplot2-based plots
- Feature 3: Run regression models with a single function

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and set up your R project. Depending on the nature of your project (an R package, script, or Shiny app), the installation steps may vary.

### Option 1: Install from GitHub

You can use the `devtools` package to install the project directly from GitHub.

1. Install the `devtools` package if you donâ€™t have it already:
    ```r
    install.packages("devtools")
    ```

2. Install the project:
    ```r
    devtools::install_github("yourusername/yourproject")
    ```

### Option 2: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```

2. Open the R project in RStudio or another IDE, and install required dependencies. You can install all packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` or `requirements.R`:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse"))  # Add relevant package names
    ```

## Usage

Provide instructions for using your project. Include sample code and examples if possible.

### Example 1: Data Cleaning
```r
# Load the package
library(yourproject)

# Clean dataset
cleaned_data <- clean_data(raw_data)
